      <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine a Minecraft world. HTML is like the world itself like the mountains, the valleys, oceans, and even the villages. This is the structure of the world but so far everything is motionless, bland, and empty. That's where CSS comes in, bringing color and textures to the world to make everything more lively! However, the world is still motionless. That's where the player comes in which will be JavaScript! The player is able to move blocks around, change the styles and decorations for blocks, and create or destroy anything within the world!

      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
      <p>
        Control flow refers to the order in which a task is supposed to be handled, just like cooking a recipe. Say you're making yourself a hot dog that means you'd have toâ€¦
        <br><br>
        - Cook the hotdog and some onions
        <br>
        - Place hotdog in bun
        <br>
        - Place onions on top
        <br>
        - And finally put on some sauces!
        <br><br>
        And a loop is like if you were to make a bunch of hot dogs for a group of people. Still doing the same tasks with maybe some slight changes like whether or not the person wants onions or sauces and repeating that task until you've met a requirement such as everyone having a hotdog!
      </p>
      <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM, which stands for Document Object Model, is a tree structure that allows JavaScript to interact with HTML where it is able to add, remove, and change elements within the webpage. If we go back to the Minecraft example before, the DOM is like the player's hand or tools allowing the player to be able to interact with the world in the first place. Below there's a button that if clicked will interact with the JavaScript on this page to change the text of the button!
      </p>
      <button id="change-btn-txt">Click Me!</button>
      <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
      <p>
        An array is just a container for a bunch of values, imagine you just have a line of boxes with an object inside of it and will look something like this!
        <br><br>
        items = ['barbie', 'Iphone 12', 5]
        <br><br>
        It's nice to have a way to have all of these stored but for now these are just closed off boring boxes which all look the same. Now you are able to skip to certain boxes by their order such as if you KNEW the Iphone was in the second position you'd be able to tell the code to skip straight to it. But if we dont know whats in each box by the order alone, how are we going to be able to know what's inside instead of having to open each box one by one? That's when objects come in! Now each box can have a label on it telling you exactly what the box is for and would look something like this...
        <br><br>
        items = {toy: 'baribe', phone: 'Iphone', cash: 5}
        <br><br>
        Now, instead of the code having to go through each box to see if it has the right item it'll be able to look at the label/key on the box such as the key cash where it will be able to look in and find the value of 5 in it!
      </p>
      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are pieces of code that you can call back to run whenever you want. Imagine again the Minecraft example and say you were trying to build a huge city. Which in this city says you need to build a few hospitals. Now it's a huge task to make the hospital just once and it's going to be even harder making it all over again. Well imagine if the first time you built it you were able to store all the info used to make it and when you wanted to make it again it's able to just instantly make it again! That's what functions are and if you wanted to spice it up a little you can give these function parameters to make the code do different things each time it's called. Such as if you wanted the building a different width, length, or height you're able to just insert those when calling the function and it'll do all the work for you!
