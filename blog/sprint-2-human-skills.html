      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        Anything within the tech industry would be an absolute dream. Perfebly,
        having a job that gives me financial stability would be a nice addition
        but, who doesn't want that right? I do have my eye on jobs like an IT
        manager in the long long run but that could change and what really
        matters to me right now is just getting my foot in the door in the
        industry.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think one of my main strengths is that once I really get into the flow
        of things I'm able to hunker down and do my best work for as long as
        possible. One of my limitations though, is that it's hard to get started
        in the first place. What I want to be able to develop within the course
        is the ability to just unlock and get into that state whenever it's
        needed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Being able to work with a group consistently and efficiently would be a
        big game changer for me as that's always been one of my key weaknesses.
        Another skill I would love to develop during the course is being able to
        start work as soon as it's put in front of me rather than
        procrastinating until I'm close to the deadline where I normally in high
        school would do the work the night before it was due.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:<br /><br />An explanation of how you will manage
        yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
        Facilitators and industry/community representatives<br /><br />What you
        will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think taking regular breaks that <u>DON'T</u> include being on the
        computer and doing something like just going outside for some fresh air
        is not only going to help bring down any stress when things might be
        building up and getting to me, but it'll also help me be more relaxed
        and easier to work with other people that I may be grouped up with.
        Making it easier to communicate and work effectively with other people
        throughout the course.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        If I do end up stuck with a problem, the main plan is after trying to
        figure it out on my own for at least 10-15 minutes. After that time is
        up, I plan to spend roughly the same amount of time searching the web on
        sites such as Stack Overflow to see how other people have tackled the
        problem and seeing if I can understand the concept through that.
        However, if I still lack a full understanding or don't have a solution
        at all, that's when I'll reach out to the Dev Academy discord server for
        any assistance or help for the problem I have.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitation team to be a safety net and a guide throughout
        the learning journey. By laying out the path ahead of us to succeed and
        develop as developers and letting us explore it ourselves but also being
        there to help pick us up and set us back on track whenever we have too
        much difficulty, stumble, or fall behind.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Currently I don't have any commitments so I'm able to devote all my
        attention to the course!

      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        It's still anything within the tech industry where I'm able to expand on
        whatever skillset I have by the end of the course. I want to be able to
        have a high headroom for possible career opportunities as well, so I
        have a lot of options to move forward with but at the end of the day, I
        just need a job...
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For sure working within groups. I think more in depth though would just
        be the start of meeting everyone face to face and just getting
        comfortable with those people and being able to work and communicate
        with them efficiently will be a difficulty that I would rather get over
        sooner rather than later!
      </p>
      <h3>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        On topic of what I said before I really want to be able to adapt to new
        environments, new teams, and new people quickly and be able to just
        start getting the work done to a high level as soon as I possibly can
        instead of awkwardly taking my time to get used to my new teammates!
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>
        Being a guiding hand, I want to be able to develop not only the skills
        themselves brought forward by the course but the skills to be able to
        overcome and figure out how to tackle the problems in the first place
        will be a key skill to learn. But still I know there will be times I'll
        trip and fall and I guess my expectations from the bootcamp team it's
        just being able to help me back onto my feet ASAP so I don't end up
        falling behind too much!
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
        The course should always come first, doesn't matter if a friend wants to
        hang out later on a day or there's a new update to a game I really want
        to be able to just get that mindset where I'm able to crush out anything
        that's thrown at me as soon as it's handed to me rather than sitting on
        it and leaving it till "later". While of course I need to pace myself to
        not overwork I also don't want to end up complacent and end up losing
        plenty of valuable learning opportunities!

      <h3>
        How accurate were your foundations expectations of your learning needs
        and growth areas?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Not accurate in any way... I thought there was gonna be less work, but
        at the same time, it feels like not enough as the time working on
        everything just flys by and all of a sudden its 5pm and time to go home!
        This has put off my approach to my learning needs and growth and I've
        found the best for me is to usally put my head down and get the work
        done, nothing more and nothing less. I've grown far more than I have
        expected though which has been a very nice suprise so what I do must be
        working.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Were there any surprises / did you learn new things about yourself?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I've found once I get more comfortable that I work within team settings
        better than I expected and has soared past my own expectations. While I
        still have things to work on in that department and a life time worth of
        growth within it I've still done myself very proud of what I've been
        able to do within the team enviroments to atleast my own expectations.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What challenges/barriers did you find in following your learning and
        wellbeing plan? How might you overcome some of these barriers as you
        proceed through the rest of your time in bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <p>
        There was no way I could have fully understanded what I was getting into
        and the predictions I did have were way way way off. Alot of personal
        life issues have taken its toll during the course which I couldnt have
        expected so a lot of it has been going with the flow. The best I can do
        is to do the small things every day to keep myself afloat and making
        sure to take care of my mind, soul, and body to the best of my ability.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What benefits did you experience from following your learning and
        wellbeing plan?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Sadly none... as I already said I didnt expect what was going to come in
        bootcamp at all. The best I can say is probably just sticking to
        figuring out a problem on my own for 10-15 minutes but even then I'm
        said I was going to ask around after that time was up is just a thing I
        havent done...

      <h3>
        Are any of the walls of my whare in need of strengthening? How might I
        do this?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Most likely mental and emotional, a lot of personal problems have been
        popping up recently which isnt the best for the last 3 and most full on
        weeks of bootcamp. Theres a lot of stress at the moment that I already
        do my best to address so the best I can do to strengthen it is to make
        sure I properlly communicate to my team maates on where I'm at
        essepcially on low days so there's not too much pressure put on myself
        or even more stress added from situations that may arise from not
        communicating.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are some of my key needs at the moment and are there some
        strategies I could try for meeting these needs?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Proper sleep and rest. Luckily there are going to be more hybrid days
        coming up so while I do want to come in as often as I can, if its worth
        it and people are there as well, I still need to make sure I have a
        healthy balance coming into these stressful weeks and trying to get as
        much rest inbetween work as possible.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What does my stress profile look like? What does stress look like
        externally (how might others tell)? What does it feel like internally
        (how might you know)?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I shut off when I'm stressed and I tend to go into my own little bubble.
        Which can be pretty easy to spot from the outside esspecially if you
        have seen my better days. Leaning more towards solo work and away from
        social interactions are pretty clear cut signs that im stressed
        externally. Internally, just like externally, I just shut off in a way.
        I find peace in being able to burry my head into work but nothing
        outside of that and again, is prett easy to notice. What I need is
        usally what I'm leaning towards, which is my own space and time to just
        focus on something that distracts me until I'm able to calm down or get
        some decent rest.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What’s a wellbeing experiment I can try over the next few weeks (this
        doesn’t have to be a grand time consuming gesture, it could be something
        small like taking a few deep breaths before opening your computer).
      </h3>
      <p>
        When I do come to campus, brining more food. I usally dont have the time
        to eat breakfast in the morning so sometimes if I'm esspecially hungry I
        find myself eating lunch for breakfast. So this leads to me also having
        to go down cuba for lunch and ending up eating something pretty
        unhealthy which I can assume isnt the best for the mental in the long
        run...
