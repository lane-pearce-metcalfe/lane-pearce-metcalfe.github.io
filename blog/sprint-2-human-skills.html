      <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
      <h2 class="dashes">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        It's still anything within the tech industry where I'm able to expand on whatever skillset I have by the end of the course. I want to be able to have a high headroom for possible career opportunities as well, so I have a lot of options to move forward with but at the end of the day, I just need a job...
      </p>
      <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>
        For sure working within groups. I think more in depth though would just be the start of meeting everyone face to face and just getting comfortable with those people and being able to work and communicate with them efficiently will be a difficulty that I would rather get over sooner rather than later!
      </p>
      <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>
        On topic of what I said before I really want to be able to adapt to new environments, new teams, and new people quickly and be able to just start getting the work done to a high level as soon as I possibly can instead of awkwardly taking my time to get used to my new teammates!
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>
        Being a guiding hand, I want to be able to develop not only the skills themselves brought forward by the course but the skills to be able to overcome and figure out how to tackle the problems in the first place will be a key skill to learn. But still I know there will be times I'll trip and fall and I guess my expectations from the bootcamp team it's just being able to help me back onto my feet ASAP so I don't end up falling behind too much!
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
        The course should always come first, doesn't matter if a friend wants to hang out later on a day or there's a new update to a game I really want to be able to just get that mindset where I'm able to crush out anything that's thrown at me as soon as it's handed to me rather than sitting on it and leaving it till "later". While of course I need to pace myself to not overwork I also don't want to end up complacent and end up losing plenty of valuable learning opportunities!
      </p>

      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        Anything within the tech industry would be an absolute dream. Perfebly, having a job that gives me financial stability would be a nice addition but, who doesn't want that right? I do have my eye on jobs like an IT manager in the long long run but that could change and what really matters to me right now is just getting my foot in the door in the industry.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p>
        I think one of my main strengths is that once I really get into the flow of things I'm able to hunker down and do my best work for as long as possible. One of my limitations though, is that it's hard to get started in the first place. What I want to be able to develop within the course is the ability to just unlock and get into that state whenever it's needed.
      </p>
      <h3>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>
        Being able to work with a group consistently and efficiently would be a big game changer for me as that's always been one of my key weaknesses. Another skill I would love to develop during the course is being able to start work as soon as it's put in front of me rather than procrastinating until I'm close to the deadline where I normally in high school would do the work the night before it was due.
      </p>
      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br><br>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives<br><br>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
      <p>
        I think taking regular breaks that <u>DON'T</u> include being on the computer and doing something like just going outside for some fresh air is not only going to help bring down any stress when things might be building up and getting to me, but it'll also help me be more relaxed and easier to work with other people that I may be grouped up with. Making it easier to communicate and work effectively with other people throughout the course.
      </p>
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>
        If I do end up stuck with a problem, the main plan is after trying to figure it out on my own for at least 10-15 minutes. After that time is up, I plan to spend roughly the same amount of time searching the web on sites such as Stack Overflow to see how other people have tackled the problem and seeing if I can understand the concept through that. However, if I still lack a full understanding or don't have a solution at all, that's when I'll reach out to the Dev Academy discord server for any assistance or help for the problem I have.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitation team to be a safety net and a guide throughout the learning journey. By laying out the path ahead of us to succeed and develop as developers and letting us explore it ourselves but also being there to help pick us up and set us back on track whenever we have too much difficulty, stumble, or fall behind.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Currently I don't have any commitments so I'm able to devote all my attention to the course!
