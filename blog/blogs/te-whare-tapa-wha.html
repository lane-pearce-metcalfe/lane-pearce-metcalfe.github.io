      <h1><u>Te Whare Tapa Whā</u></h1>
      <p>
        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a wellbeing model desgined to provide a Māori
        perspective on health that consists of... <br /><br />taha hinengaro
        (mental wellbeing)<br />taha tinana (physical wellbeing)<br />taha
        wairua (spiritual wellbeing)<br />taha whānau (family wellbeing)<br />and
        Whenua (land and roots)<br /><br />
        Below is my plan to stay connected with these 4 walls and the Whenua
        throughout my learning journey!
      </p>
      <h3><u>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</u></h3>
      <p>
        I plan to go on a run every day (taking rest days of course) with every
        second day being more of a walk/jog day. I've already started to try to
        implement this within my life but I want to make a full and official
        commintment here!
      </p>
      <h3><u>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</u></h3>
      <p>
        I'm planning on going to the Wellington Saints basketball games with my
        mum as regularly as I can, but also I've been learning to drive and I
        plan to get more practice in as I can as my grandad has been teaching me
        and that connection and experince means alot to him.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</u></h3>
      <p>
        Keeping a solid and healthy sleep schedule, esspecially coming into the
        bootcamp part of the course, is going to be key to my learning process
        so I plan on going to sleep earlier (than normal) and waking up
        consistently at a resonable time.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</u></h3>
      <p>
        I'm not much of a spiritual person however I think being grateful for
        this world we live in and seeing the positive and beatutiful side of it
        can come under this wall. So therefore, I want to find more
        opportunities to just go on strolls outside, taking my time and staying
        around as much nature as possible.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</u></h3>
      <p>
        Just like Taha Wairua where I plan to stay connected to nature as much
        as possible, I would like to atleast twice a week go out with my dog to
        a local field just to a throw a ball and just be present in the moment
        with the land and the nature around me.
