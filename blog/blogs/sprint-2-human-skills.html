      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <h3><u>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</u></h3>
      <p>
        Anything within the tech industry would be an abosulte dream. Perfebly,
        having a job that gives me financial stability would be a nice addition
        but, who doesnt want that right? I do have my eye on jobs like an IT
        manager in the long long run but that could change and what really
        matters to me right now is just getting my foot in the door in the
        industry.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think one of my main strengths is that once I really get into the flow
        of things I'm able to hunker down and do my best work for as long as
        possible. One of my limitations though, is that its hard to get started
        in the first place. What I want to be able to develope within the course
        is the ability to just unlock and get into that state whenever its
        needed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Being able to work with a group consistantly and efficently would be a
        big game changer for me as thats always been one of my key weaknesses.
        Another skill I would love to devlope during the course is being able to
        start work as soon as its put infront of me rather than procasinating
        until im close to the deadline where I normally in high school would do
        the work the night before it was due.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include:
        </u>
      </h3>
      <h4>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
      </h4>
      <h4>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h4>
      <p>
        I think taking regular breaks that <u>DONT</u> include being on the computer and doing something like just going outside for some freash air is not only going to help bring down any stress when things might be building up and getting to me, but it'll also help me be more relaxed and easier to work with other people that I may be grouped up with. Making it easier to communicate and work with effectivley with other people throughout the course.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
    </u>
      <p>
        If I do end up stuck with a problem, the main plan is after trying to
        figure it out on my own for atleast 10-15 minutes. After that time is
        up, I plan to spend roughly the same amount of time searching the web on
        sites such as Stack Overflow to see how other people have tackled the
        problem and seeing if I can understand the concept throught that.
        However, if I still lack a full understanding or dont have a solution at
        all thats when I'll reach out to the Dev Academy discord server for any
        assistance or help for the problem I have.
      </p>
      <h3><u>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</u></h3>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitation team to be a saftey net and a guide throughout
        the learning journey. By laying out the path ahead of us to succeded and
        devlope as devlopers and letting us explore it ourselves but also being
        there to help pick us up and set us back on track whenever we have too
        much difficulty, stumble, or fall behind.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </u>
      </h3>
      <p>Currently I don't have any commitments so I'm able to devote all my attention to course!</p>
