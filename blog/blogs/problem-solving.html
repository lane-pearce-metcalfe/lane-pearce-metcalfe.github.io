      <h3><u>Were blocked on a simple problem:</u></h3>
      <p>
        Theres plenty of times I've been stuck on a "simple" problem that seems
        almost trivial. Wether if its using src="" or href="" for linking a CSS
        file to an HTML file or how to use a for loop properly plenty of times
        I've tripped up on these. First of all I do try to figure out these
        problems by just giving it a minute or two to fully stop myself in my
        tracks and give myself the head room to clear up any brain fog. However,
        if I'm still stuck on a "simple" problem, usally the reason why it's
        simple in the first place is because I've used it plenty of times in the
        past which means I have plenty of content to backtrack on to use as
        refernces!
      </p>
      <h3><u>Elegantly solved a problem:</u></h3>
      <p>
        I wouldnt call any of my methods or processes elegant but I think the
        closest thing to it is working through the MDN Web Docs throughly to
        grasp full or atleast the most knowledge I can on a certain topic before
        putting it into use.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u
          >Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
          techniques/processes:</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        <u>Pseudocode:</u>
        <br />
        Ive the Pseudocode process a decent chunk of times before esspecially in
        more complicated and large projects with lots of functions being used.
        Writing out different steps of the process and creating chunks of codes
        or functions for that process and connecting them together have helped
        with plenty of dips within my work before so I'm very confident with
        Pseudocode!
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>Trying something:</u>
        <br />
        Trying to brute force the solution with whatever knowledge I already
        have has lead to a ton of learning opurtunitys and is one of my main
        go-tos when it comes to certain problems so Im also very confident with
        just "trying out" solutions!
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>Rubber ducky method:</u>
        <br />
        I've tried this a few times before, it doesnt really get me anywhere and
        I only find myself doing this when I havent taken the proper time and
        care with devloping my code in the first place and is more of an
        indicator that I need to slow down with my process and put more care
        into my work. The Rubber ducky method is something I'm confident in
        doing but doesnt personally yeild much results.
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>Reading error messages:</u>
        <br />
        Error messages are still very 50/50 for me. As half of the time it
        points me towards the exact line and a giving me a simple message
        letting me know I've made a basic mistake. However, half of the time it
        also gives me a complicated error message that even after googling
        around for half an hour still doesnt begin to help me figure out what
        might be going wrong in my code. So its nice for pointing out common
        mistakes at the moment but anything past that is just too much for me...
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>Console.logging:</u>
        <br />
        I <b>LOVE</b> console logging, esspecially being used with the trying
        out method. When the code wont do what I ask of it, I might as well get
        it to tell me exactly whats happening and is something that I find
        myself using all of the time so I'm very confident with console logging!
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>Googling:</u>
        <br />
        Googling is another 50/50 kind of situation. While it can help point me
        towards a well documented and thought out solution that I'm able to
        follow along with and gets me more confident to tackle the same problem
        in the future. It can also give me outdated solutions, completely
        unrelated topics, or badly written/have a lack of docmentation...
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>Asking your peers/coaches for help</u>
        <br />
        If I'm going to be honest I havent found myself using this method that
        much yet so I'll say I'm not confident in it at all at the moment.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u
          >Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next
          time?</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        I've been reluctant plenty of times so far throughout the course, I'm
        usally to heavily reliant on my own methods and processes that I kind of
        forget that valubale insight I don't just recive but can give to my
        fellow peers. I think it could be opening a nice door to more
        conversation and learning oppurtunitys for everyone involved so I for
        sure want to get more into the habit of talking to more people in the
        co-hort in the future.
