      <h1><u>Foundations Reflections!</u></h1>
      <h3>
        <u
          >What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the Human Skills learning?</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        One of the things I learnt was how terrible I am in the human skills
        "department" when the connections arent natural and within my comfort
        zone and that it takes alot of energy to push myself towards making
        these connections.<br /><br />
        I also learnt that while I'm completely capable of getting my work done
        when I get it. Throughout highschool I struggled a ton with
        procrastination and thought that was just a part of me. Turns out I just
        wasnt engaged with the content I was learning in school and now that I'm
        in a field and enviroment I'm actually pasionate about procrastination
        isnt a part of me and I'm totally capable of being a productive
        person!<br /><br />
        I also do have a bit of an ego on the tech side of this course. Before
        the course started I made sure to prepare myself as much as possible on
        the tech side and havent taken any of the tech learning side of
        foundations too seriously and underestimated it. If had to spend alot of
        energy grounding myself and forcing myself to go through that learning
        process again to make sure I am really doing everything to a high
        standard incase of any bad habits I may have built while self learning!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u
          >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think being able to have high standards within each of these
        categories is exteremlly important is this industry in this day and age.
        Technology is extremlly powerful and literally runs our world and put
        within the wrong hands could be dangerous for everyone involved. Also
        having a high standard within values, empathy, and self-awreness can
        make you an anchor within a group esspecially while working on a
        project. Being able to fairly take in everyones views and values and be
        able to handle every interaction with care and attentivness can avoid a
        dysfunctional group and lead to the team to levels of productivity they
        didnt even think they had in them!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think mainly how much of the course its included in. I originally
        thought it was going to be a side thing that would take about half a day
        out of every week but seeing how involved it was took me back quite a
        bit!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u
          >What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills
          learning?</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        One hundred percent trying to make those connections and reaching out
        via the discord to new people I didnt really know yet.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u
          >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        As I said before I think its very important ethically as of how powerful
        technology is and being able to handle it properly is something everyone
        in the industry needs to learn. But also it is key to be able to work in
        a team as you'll never really be a solo developer within the industry
        and need that expereince to work well within groups and to most
        importantly get a job in the first place!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u
          >Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like
          a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
          programming instead? Justify your answer.</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        If anything I should have spent more time on it. I've already tried to
        get as good at the techincal side as I could before the course started
        but didnt have the chance to get ahead on the human skills side so the
        time Ive spent on the human skills section has not been a waste of time
        and if anything I wish I could have gotten a headstart before the course
        started.
