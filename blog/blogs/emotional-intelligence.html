      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <h3><u>EQ VS IQ</u></h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the world IQ is highly celebrated metric as its shows
        someones intelligence within logical tasks and their resoning ability.
        Now while this is important essepcailly within the modern world, theres
        still IQs underated sibling EQ, which you could argue is far more
        important. EQ refernces someones level of managing and understanding not
        just ones emotions, but others as well making it easier to build strong
        relationships with others. Theres not much use in IQ if your not able to
        connect with others around you to share those ideas or even worse, using
        that IQ in immoral and damaging ways that impact others lives!
      </p>
      <h3><u>How do you gain EQ?</u></h3>
      <p>
        Theres many ways to gain EQ or even exersize it but first of all we'll
        be looking in towards ourselves and it the next section we'll focus on
        practicing our EQ externally to another person! For now though, what
        could one do in their own time?<br /><br />
        <p><u>Meditation</u></p>
        <p>
          Meditation is a perfect time to have everything else in the day slow down. Making sure you have no distractions it gives you a free a calm space to look into yourself and recognise and better understand any emotions you may have bubbling up. This awareness allows you to better handle these emotions when they might shine through in future situations!
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p><u>Journaling</u></p>
        <p>
          Journaling is a great practice as it can help decluter your mind, allowing any mess and complications youve had stuck up in your head to just be thrown down on the paper as either a way to just get rid of it, or to better understand it. It can also help reduce stress or anger as youd much rather throw down your anger on a peice of paper rather than to someones face!
        </p>
      </p>
      <h3><u>How do you PRACTICE your EQ?</u></h3>
      <p>
        For this I'll be personally seeing where I'm at in my EQ journey and for
        this, I'll be partnering up with someone else within my cohort. I'll be
        partnering up with ___ and together we'll be doing the "Loop and Listen"
        practice. In which we'll be having one person talk to the other
        uniterupted for 2 minutes straight about any topic and the other person
        will have to listen and retain as much as they can about that topic as
        possible. Then they listener will have to bounce back as much
        information about the topic they were told about back to the original
        speaker. And after they'll switch places!<br /><br />
        <p>
          I partnered up with my friend Chris for this exersize and I talked <u>TO</u> him first. I talked about albums such as Blond by Frank Ocean, DAMN by Kendrick Lamar, and esspecially Igor by Tyler The Creator and their overarching theme of being able to be listened in differnet ways that lead to a different listening experience. Chris has always been a great listener and was able to almost perfectly bounce back all my talking points and mirrored it perfectly!
        </p>
        <p>
          Next up I was listening. I noticed that I would usally not be able to keep up with everything he was saying and missed out on some of the details but was able to grasp most of it and the general points he was making. Also, next time I need to make sure that I don't have any potential distactions around me as I had a few notifications that took my attention away from time to time. However, I was still able to rebound back his points to him very well and he said he had no complaints!
