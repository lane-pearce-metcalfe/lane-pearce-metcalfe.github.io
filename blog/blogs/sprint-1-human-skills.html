        Joining this course itself was a big decision. I knew I would have to
        cut connections to some people close to me esspecially during the main
        chunk of the bootcamp section and I could potentially lose those
        connections for a while. But this is something I really wanted to do and
        after taking a gap year from school I needed to get something in my life
        going soon, so I had to bet on myself. Looking back on it now, I was
        eventually going to lose those connections eventually and I made the
        right choice of deciding to focus on myself.

        Alot of my growing experinces in highschool usally wasnt first hand.
        While near the start I got into my fair share of trouble, I calmed down
        pretty quickly and usally stood off to the side socially. This gave me
        alot of situations where I was able to watch people go through their own
        personal mistakes and life lessons and saw how the consequences effected
        them without having to face them myself. If I never calmed down and
        stood to the side I was starting on the path of making some big
        mistakes. But instead, I've chilled down alot more as a person and I'm
        very lucky and happy that I have.

        I think I am a very hard and focused worker when I'm given the space and
        the time to get into the flow of it. I also love and get a alot of
        satisfaction from solving thinking problems/puzzles which for something
        like software devlopment, is going to be a huge help!

        I'm not the best when it comes to group work. It's one of the main
        reasons why I wanted to do this course because group work is a huge part
        of it and I wanted to be able to devlope the skill. Still, at the end of
        the day it'll be an obstacle that I have to overcome and will most
        likely lead to some difficulty at first.

        I did buisness studies in my last year of high school and for it we had
        to get together in groups at the start of the year and come together to
        make a finished product and buisness. However, I didn't have many people
        I knew in the class so I got forced into a group of people who were
        already friends. It didn't help that I was the complete polar oppisate
        of them as well and found it difficult to connect on a personal level.
        After trying, and failing, to connect with them personally what I tried
        and ended up working was just doing the work. By showing off that I had
        value as a team member for their buisness I was able to build a bridge
        which then I was able to build personal connections with. I think my
        mistake might have been that I came off as someone who just wanted to
        talk and mess around and was seen as a potential liability rather then a
        potential teammate. Next time, I think some small talk being nice and
        having an introduction is nice when being put with a new team but at the
        end of the day I was there to do work and showing that I could do that
        eliminated any potential conflicts.
