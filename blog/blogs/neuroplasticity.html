      <h1><u>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</u></h1>
      <h3>Research Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <h3>

      <p>
        First let me lay out that a fixed mindset not only leads to stagnant but
        a negative learning process as the brain needs its "exercise" to keep up
        its neural pathways and neglecting those pathways leads to
        deterioration.<br />As well as the fact that a growth mindset leads to
        the brain constantly pushing itself and exercising those pathways
        leading to a positive learning process.<br /><br />This is the idea of
        neuroplasticity, that your brain is able to mold and you're able to grow
        within whatever topic you desire just by using these simple ideas to
        your advantage.<br />Just from the simple concept of a fixed mindset
        leads to those pathways deteriorating and a growth mindset on the other
        side literally growing those pathways, it's very clear and obvious how
        using neuroplasticity to your advantage can benefit you!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u
          >Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit.</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        As I said before, your brain needs to constantly have its "exercise" to
        keep those neural pathways working and growing. So I plan to constantly
        engage with the learning resources of the course. This could be done in
        multiple ways such as stretching out the work throughout the week to
        make sure I don't do everything in the first half of the week and do
        nothing the other half, negating all the work I've done in the first
        place! Even if I do manage to finish everything early, even adding bite
        size exercises to my routine to make sure I have something to keep
        afloat especially on the weekend can go a long way!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Consistently and regularly engaging in difficult or challenging
        activities will give your brain plenty to feed off of to keep itself
        growing and improving. Prioritizing sleep and mindfulness is also a key
        to being in the right place at all times to keep yourself able to take
        on these difficult activities. You wouldn't be able to take on these
        massive tasks if you feel like a zombie from your 2 hours of sleep or
        feel like your life is crashing around you...
      </p>
      <h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>
      <h3><u>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</u></h3>
      <p>
        As I said before, constantly giving yourself difficult learning
        opportunities leads to a ton of brain growth and is a hundred times more
        preferred to the other option which is just letting your brain
        deteriorate and your knowledge shrinking... but to be able to move
        forward in the first place you need to be in the right headspace. That's
        where a growth mindset comes into place! Being able to recognize and
        keep yourself motivated by the fact your able to always expand your
        knowledge and capabilities with the right approach and enough work is
        the start you need to get it done in the first place. Unlocking this
        mindset is key to being able to take on this challenging process and
        will lead to so many opportunities and possibilities!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Going through highschool, I had plenty of teachers who promoted a growth
        mindset classroom. However, I didn't value my education let alone my
        growth in that time so I just kind of brushed it off. But after
        highschool I learnt the hard way how much a good education and the
        skills you learn within that education really matter. Now faced with the
        same concepts I was shown in highschool, I can see how much it matters
        for my growth and my future and it's able to resonate a lot more. What's
        changed is that this time around I genuinely plan to implement this
        approach in my learning process and hope it's able to bring me to as
        many learning opportunities as possible.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        As I said before, I plan to spread out my work so my brain always has
        something to feed off on and is constantly growing. But it's also key to
        note now, that those activities I'll be giving myself, need to be
        difficult and challenging. While doing something I'm already comfortable
        is technically beneficial and helps my brain not deteriorate. It'll be a
        lot more nicer to have the opportunity to have my knowledge grow, rather
        than be stagnant!
