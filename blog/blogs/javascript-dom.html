      <h3>
        <u
          >An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
          CSS</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        Imagine a Minecraft world. HTML is like the world itself like the
        mountains, the valleys, oceans, and even the villages this is the
        structure of the world but so far everything is motionless, bland, and
        empty. Thats where CSS comes in, bringing color and textures to the
        world to make everything more lively! However, the world is still
        motionless. Thats where the player comes in which will be JavaScript!
        The player is able to move blocks around, change the styles and
        decorations for blocks, and create or destroy anything within the world!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u
          >Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        Control flow refers to the order in which a task is supposed to be
        handled, just like cooking a recipe. Say youre making yourself a hot dog
        that means youd have to <br /><br />
        - Cook the hotdog and some onions <br />
        - Place hotdog in bun <br />
        - Place onions ontop <br />
        - And finally put on some sauces! <br /><br />
        And a loop is like if you were to make a bunch of hot dogs for a group
        of people. Still doing the same tasks with maybe some slight changes
        like wether or not the person wants onions or sauces and repeating that
        task until youve met a requirment such as everone having a hotdog!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <u
          >Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
          with it.</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        The DOM, which stands for Document Object Model, is a tree structure
        that allows JavaScript to interact with HTML where its able to add,
        remove, and change elements within the webpage. If we go back to the
        Minecraft example before, the DOM is like the players hand or tools
        allowing the player to be able to interact with the world in the first
        place. Below theres a button that if click will interact with the
        JavaScript on this page to change the text of the button!
      </p>
      <button id="change-btn-txt">Click Me!</button>
      <h3>
        <u
          >Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
          objects</u
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        An array is just a container for a bunch of values, imagine you just
        have a line of boxes with an object inside of it and will look something
        like this!<br /><br />
        items = ['barbie', 'Iphone 12', 5]<br /><br />
        It's nice to have a way to have all of these stored but for now these
        are just closed off boring boxes which all look the same. Now you are
        able to skip to certain boxes by their order such as if you KNEW the
        Iphone was in the second position you'd be able to tell the code to skip
        straight to it. But if we dont know whats in each box by the order
        alone, how are we going to be able to know whats inside instead of
        having to open each box one by one? Thats when objects come in! Now each
        box can have a label on it telling you exactly what the box is for and
        would look something like this...
        <br /><br />
        items = {toy: 'baribe', phone: 'Iphone', cash: 5}
        <br /><br />
        Now instead of the code having to go through each box to see if it has
        the right item it'll be able to look at the label/key on the box such as
        the key cash where it will be able to look in and find the value of 5 in
        it!
      </p>
      <h3><u>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</u></h3>
      <p>
        Functions are peices of code that you can call back to run whenever you
        want. Imagine again the Minecraft example and say you were trying to
        build a huge city. Which in this city say you needed to build a few
        hostipals. Now its a huge task to make the hostipal just once and its
        going to be even harder making it all over again. Well imagine if the
        first time you built it you were able to store all the info used to make
        it and when you wanted to make it again its able to just instantly make
        it again! Thats what functions are and if you wanted to spice it up a
        little you can give these function paramaters to make the code do
        different things each time its called. Such as if you wanted the
        building a differnt width, length, or height your able to just insert
        those when calling the function and itll do all the work for you!
