      <h3>Were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
      <p>
        There's plenty of times I've been stuck on a "simple" problem that seems almost trivial. Whether it's using src="" or href="" for linking a CSS file to an HTML file or how to use a for loop properly plenty of times I've tripped up on these. First of all I do try to figure out these problems by just giving it a minute or two to fully stop myself in my tracks and give myself the head room to clear up any brain fog. However, if I'm still stuck on a "simple" problem, usually the reason why it's simple in the first place is because I've used it plenty of times in the past which means I have plenty of content to backtrack on to use as references!
      </p>
      <h3>Elegantly solved a problem:</h3>
      <p>
        I wouldn't call any of my methods or processes elegant but I think the closest thing to it is working through the MDN Web Docs thoroughly to grasp full or at least the most knowledge I can on a certain topic before putting it into use.
      </p>
      <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
      <p>
        <u>Pseudocode:</u>
        <br><br>
        I've used the Pseudocode process a decent chunk of times before, especially in more complicated and large projects with lots of functions being used. Writing out different steps of the process and creating chunks of codes or functions for that process and connecting them together have helped with plenty of dips within my work before so I'm very confident with Pseudocode!
        <br><br>
        <u>Trying something:</u>
        <br><br>
        Trying to brute force the solution with whatever knowledge I already have has led to a ton of learning opportunities and is one of my main go-tos when it comes to certain problems so I'm also very confident with just "trying out" solutions!
        <br><br>
        <u>Rubber ducky method:</u>
        <br><br>
        I've tried this a few times before, it doesn't really get me anywhere and I only find myself doing this when I haven't taken the proper time and care with developing my code in the first place and is more of an indicator that I need to slow down with my process and put more care into my work. The Rubber ducky method is something I'm confident in doing but doesn't personally yield much results.
        <br><br>
        <u>Reading error messages:</u>
        <br></br>
        Error messages are still very 50/50 for me. As half of the time it points me towards the exact line and gives me a simple message letting me know I've made a basic mistake. However, half of the time it also gives me a complicated error message that even after googling around for half an hour still doesn't begin to help me figure out what might be going wrong in my code. So it's nice for pointing out common mistakes at the moment but anything past that is just too much for me...
        <br><br>
        <u>Console.logging:</u>
        <br><br>
        I <b>LOVE</b> console logging, especially being used with the trying out method. When the code won't do what I ask of it, I might as well get it to tell me exactly what's happening and is something that I find myself using all of the time so I'm very confident with console logging!
        <br><br>
        <u>Googling:</u>
        <br><br>
        Googling is another 50/50 kind of situation. While it can help point me towards a well documented and thought out solution that I'm able to follow along with and gets me more confident to tackle the same problem in the future. It can also give me outdated solutions, completely unrelated topics, or badly written/have a lack of documentation...
        <br><br>
        <u>Asking your peers/coaches for help:</u>
        <br><br>
        If I'm going to be honest I haven't found myself using this method that much yet so I'll say I'm not confident in it at all at the moment.
      </p>
      <h3>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3>
      <p>
        I've been reluctant plenty of times so far throughout the course, I'm usually too heavily reliant on my own methods and processes that I kind of forget that valuable insight I don't just receive but can give to my fellow peers. I think it could be opening a nice door to more conversation and learning opportunities for everyone involved so I for sure want to get more into the habit of talking to more people in the cohort in the future.
