      <h3>What is Te Whare Tapa Whā?</h3>
      <p>
        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a wellbeing model desgined to provide a Māori perspective on health that consists of...

        taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)
        <br>
        taha tinana (physical wellbeing)
        <br>
        taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)
        <br>
        taha whānau (family wellbeing)
        <br>
        and Whenua (land and roots)
        <br><br>
        Below is my plan to stay connected with these 4 walls and the Whenua throughout my learning journey!
      </p>
      <h3>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
      <p>
        I plan to go on a run every day (taking rest days of course) with every second day being more of a walk/jog day. I've already started to try to implement this within my life but I want to make a full and official commitment here!
      </p>
      <h3>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
      <p>
        I'm planning on going to the Wellington Saints basketball games with my mum as regularly as I can, but also I've been learning to drive and I plan to get more practice in as I can as my grandad has been teaching me and that connection and experience means alot to him.
      </p>
      <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
      <p>
        Keeping a solid and healthy sleep schedule, especially coming into the bootcamp part of the course, is going to be key to my learning process so I plan on going to sleep earlier (than normal) and waking up consistently at a reasonable time.
      </p>
      <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not much of a spiritual person however I think being grateful for this world we live in and seeing the positive and beautiful side of it can come under this wall. So therefore, I want to find more opportunities to just go on strolls outside, taking my time and staying around as much nature as possible.
      </p>
      <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
      <p>
        Just like Taha Wairua where I plan to stay connected to nature as much as possible, I would like to at least twice a week go out with my dog to a local field just to throw a ball and just be present in the moment with the land and the nature around me.
