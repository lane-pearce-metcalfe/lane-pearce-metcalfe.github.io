      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p>
        One of the things I learnt was how terrible I am in the human skills "department" when the connections aren't natural and within my comfort zone and that it takes a lot of energy to push myself towards making these connections.
        <br><br>
        I also learnt that while I'm completely capable of getting my work done when I get it. Throughout highschool I struggled a ton with procrastination and thought that was just a part of me. Turns out I just wasn't engaged with the content I was learning in school and now that I'm in a field and environment I'm actually passionate about procrastination isn't a part of me and I'm totally capable of being a productive person!
        <br><br>
        I also do have a bit of an ego on the tech side of this course. Before the course started I made sure to prepare myself as much as possible on the tech side and haven't taken any of the tech learning side of foundations too seriously and underestimated it. If I had to spend a lot of energy grounding myself and forcing myself to go through that learning process again to make sure I am really doing everything to a high standard incase of any bad habits I may have built while self learning!
      </p>
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>
        I think being able to have high standards within each of these categories is extremely important in this industry in this day and age. Technology is extremely powerful and literally runs our world and putting it within the wrong hands could be dangerous for everyone involved. Also having a high standard within values, empathy, and self-awareness can make you an anchor within a group especially while working on a project. Being able to fairly take in everyone's views and values and be able to handle every interaction with care and attentiveness can avoid a dysfunctional group and lead the team to levels of productivity they didn't even think they had in them!
      </p>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think mainly about how much of the course it's included in. I originally thought it was going to be a side thing that would take about half a day out of every week but seeing how involved it was took me back quite a bit!
      </p>
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p>
        One hundred percent trying to make those connections and reaching out via the discord to new people I didn't really know yet.
      </p>
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        As I said before I think it's very important ethically as to how powerful technology is and being able to handle it properly is something everyone in the industry needs to learn. But also it is key to be able to work in a team as you'll never really be a solo developer within the industry and need that experience to work well within groups and to most importantly get a job in the first place!
      </p>
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p>
        If anything I should have spent more time on it. I've already tried to get as good at the technical side as I could before the course started but didn't have the chance to get ahead on the human skills side so the time I've spent on the human skills section has not been a waste of time and if anything I wish I could have gotten a head start before the course started.
