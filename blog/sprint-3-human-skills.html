      <h3>EQ VS IQ</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the world IQ is a highly celebrated metric as it shows someone's intelligence within logical tasks and their reasoning ability. Now while this is important especially within the modern world, there's still IQs underrated sibling EQ, which you could argue is far more important. EQ references someone's level of managing and understanding not just one's emotions, but others as well making it easier to build strong relationships with others. There's not much use in IQ if you're not able to connect with others around you to share those ideas or even worse, using that IQ in immoral and damaging ways that impact others lives!
      </p>
      <h3>How do you gain EQ?</h3>
      <p>
        There's many ways to gain EQ or even exercise it but first of all we'll be looking in towards ourselves and in the next section we'll focus on practicing our EQ externally to another person! For now though, what could one do in their own time?
        <br><br>
        <u>Meditation</u>
        <br><br>
        Meditation is a perfect time to have everything else in the day slow down. Making sure you have no distractions gives you a free, calm space to look into yourself and recognise and better understand any emotions you may have bubbling up. This awareness allows you to better handle these emotions when they might shine through in future situations!
        <br><br>
        <u>Journaling</u>
        <br><br>
        Journaling is a great practice as it can help declutter your mind, allowing any mess and complications you've had stuck up in your head to just be thrown down on the paper as either a way to just get rid of it, or to better understand it. It can also help reduce stress or anger as you'd much rather throw down your anger on a piece of paper rather than to someone's face!
      </p>
      <h3>How do you PRACTICE your EQ?</h3>
      <p>
        For this I'll be personally seeing where I'm at in my EQ journey and for this, I'll be partnering up with someone else within my cohort. I'll be partnering up with Chris and together we'll be doing the "Loop and Listen" practice. In which we'll be having one person talk to the other uninterrupted for 2 minutes straight about any topic and the other person will have to listen and retain as much as they can about that topic as possible. Then the listener will have to bounce back as much information about the topic they were told about back to the original speaker. And after they'll switch places!
        <br><br>
        I partnered up with my friend Chris for this exercise and I talked TO him first. I talked about albums such as Blond by Frank Ocean, DAMN by Kendrick Lamar, and especially Igor by Tyler The Creator and their overarching theme of being able to be listened to in different ways that lead to a different listening experience. Chris has always been a great listener and was able to almost perfectly bounce back all my talking points and mirrored it perfectly!
        <br><br>
        Next up I was listening. I noticed that I would usually not be able to keep up with everything he was saying and missed out on some of the details but was able to grasp most of it and the general points he was making. Also, next time I need to make sure that I don't have any potential distractions around me as I had a few notifications that took my attention away from time to time. However, I was still able to rebound back his points to him very well and he said he had no complaints!
