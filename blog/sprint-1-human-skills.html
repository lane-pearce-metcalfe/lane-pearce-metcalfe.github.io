      <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths exploration</h1>
      <h2 class="dashes">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>
      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
      <p>
        Joining this course itself was a big decision. I knew I would have to cut connections to some people close to me especially during the main chunk of the bootcamp section and I could potentially lose those connections for a while. But this is something I really wanted to do and after taking a gap year from school I needed to get something in my life going soon, so I had to bet on myself. Looking back on it now, I was eventually going to lose those connections eventually and I made the right choice of deciding to focus on myself.

      <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
      <p>A Lot of my growing experiences in highschool usually weren't first hand. While near the start I got into my fair share of trouble, I calmed down pretty quickly and usually stood off to the side socially. This gave me a lot of situations where I was able to watch people go through their own personal mistakes and life lessons and saw how the consequences affected them without having to face them myself. If I never calmed down and stood to the side I was starting on the path of making some big mistakes. But instead, I've chilled down a lot more as a person and I'm very lucky and happy that I have.</p>
      <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
      <p>I think I am a very hard and focused worker when I'm given the space and the time to get into the flow of it. I also love and get a lot of satisfaction from solving thinking problems/puzzles which for something like software development, is going to be a huge help!</p>
      <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>I'm not the best when it comes to group work. It's one of the main reasons why I wanted to do this course because group work is a huge part of it and I wanted to be able to develop the skill. Still, at the end of the day it'll be an obstacle that I have to overcome and will most likely lead to some difficulty at first.</p>
      <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
      <p>I did business studies in my last year of high school and for it we had to get together in groups at the start of the year and come together to make a finished product and business. However, I didn't have many people I knew in the class so I got forced into a group of people who were already friends. It didn't help that I was the complete polar opposite of them as well and found it difficult to connect on a personal level. After trying, and failing, to connect with them personally what I tried and ended up working was just doing the work. By showing off that I had value as a team member for their business I was able to build a bridge which then I was able to build personal connections with. I think my mistake might have been that I came off as someone who just wanted to talk and mess around and was seen as a potential liability rather than a potential teammate. Next time, I think some small talk being nice and having an introduction is nice when being put with a new team but at the end of the day I was there to do work and showing that I could do that eliminated any potential conflicts.
